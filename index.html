  <p> In my opinion, copywrite is something you should never do. Copywritting something can get you in a lot of trouble
  <p> When you copywrite something, you can get arrested and put in jail/juvy for a long time.
  <p> Rather than copywritting something, read whatever it is you were GOING to copywrite and put it into your own words. 
  <p> If it is something that you can't/ don't know how to rephrase, make it a quote and site where and who it is from.
  <p> For example, say you were reading about koalas and wanted to write and essay about them. 
  <p> You found information on them that you don't want to change because it is worded perfectly.
  <p> What you would do is "<i> information about koalas </i>" stated by (who and/or where the information came from) </p>
